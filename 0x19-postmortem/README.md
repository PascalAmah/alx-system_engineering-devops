**Postmortem: The Great Trip Publishing Fiasco of 2025**

---

### 🚨 Issue Summary (a.k.a. The Day Trip Publishing Went on Vacation)
**Duration:** February 26, 2025, 10:00 AM - 3:30 PM UTC (5 hours 30 minutes)  
**Impact:** Users were unable to publish new trips on TripHoppa. This affected 100% of users attempting to create and publish trips during the outage. Meanwhile, frustrated travelers were left staring at their screens, wondering if their adventures had been canceled before they even started. Other functionalities of the platform remained blissfully unaffected.  
**Root Cause:** A sneaky, half-baked database migration that forgot to pack its `status` column before deployment. 

---

### ⏳ Timeline: A Tragicomedy in Six Acts
- **10:00 AM UTC** - First user report: "Why can’t I publish my trip? 😭" 
- **10:15 AM UTC** - Internal monitoring detects `/publish-trip` API is failing more than a rookie skydiver without a parachute.
- **10:30 AM UTC** - Engineers dig through logs and discover database errors screaming about a missing column.
- **11:00 AM UTC** - "It’s probably an indexing issue," they say. (It wasn’t.)
- **12:00 PM UTC** - Attempts to fix indexing yield nothing but despair. Incident escalated to The Database Wizards™.
- **1:00 PM UTC** - Rollback attempt fails. The issue digs in like a stubborn cat refusing to leave a cozy box.
- **2:00 PM UTC** - Finally, someone notices the `status` column is missing. "Wait… was this migration even applied?"
- **3:00 PM UTC** - Database migration manually re-applied. The lost column returns home.
- **3:30 PM UTC** - Services restored, applause all around, engineers sigh in exhaustion.

### 🔍 Root Cause & Resolution
#### **The Culprit:**
A schema migration meant to add a `status` column to the `trips` table got stuck mid-deployment like a half-built bridge. This left the database in an inconsistent state where the backend expected something that simply wasn’t there.

#### **The Fix:**
- Applied the migration manually to ensure all database replicas were in sync.
- Added a pre-deployment schema validation to avoid similar half-migrations in the future.

### 🔧 Corrective & Preventative Measures (a.k.a. "How We Stop This Madness Next Time")
#### **Lessons Learned:**
- Always verify migrations before deploying. "Did we actually migrate the database?" should never be a mystery.
- Improve database schema validation to detect missing columns *before* users do.
- Strengthen monitoring for migration failures. If something half-applies, we should know before Twitter does.

#### **TODO List:**
✅ Implement pre-deployment database migration verification.  
✅ Add automated rollback procedures for failed migrations.  
✅ Improve API logging to catch schema-related errors earlier.  
✅ Conduct a retrospective review of database migration processes.  
✅ Set up an alert system so engineers don’t have to rely on angry user complaints.
